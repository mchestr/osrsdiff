OUTPUT FORMAT:
Respond with valid JSON only: {"summary": "...", "points": ["...", "...", "..."]}

CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Summary (1-2 sentences): Lead with the highest numbers/metrics. Use format: "{{ username }} gained X XP and Y levels..."
2. Points (2-3 bullets): Each point must include specific numbers
   - Point 1: Focus on top skill(s) with exact XP amounts
   - Point 2: Boss kills with specific counts and boss names
   - Point 3: Activity patterns (compare day vs week if different, or highlight consistency)

WRITING RULES:
- Start sentences with numbers: "Gained 2.9M XP" not "Made significant progress with 2.9M XP"
- Use exact values: "1.27M XP" not "over a million XP"
- Include comparisons: "100 Zulrah kills" not "many boss kills"
- Avoid weasel words: NO "significant", "impressive", "notable", "substantial", "considerable", "robust", "strong", "excellent", "great"
- Use third person with {{ username }}
- If day activity is 0 but week has activity, state: "No activity in last 24 hours"
- Be factual and direct - let the numbers speak
